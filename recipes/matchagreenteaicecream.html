        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>On a hot Summer day, one of the most <strong>perfect</strong> things to eat is...
        <em>ice-cream!</em> Combining it with Ben and Jerry's sweet cream base and authentic <em>matcha</em> green tea powder,
        get ready to embark on a tasteful adventure to Japan with the comforting swirls of ice cream and the bitter sensations of green tea.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon <em>matcha</em> green tea powder (or more to taste)</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk matcha powder in a bowl to remove any lumps. Add a splash of milk and whisk until the <em>matcha</em> powder is completely dissolved. Gradually whisk in remaining milk.</li>
            <li>Transfer matcha mixture to a pot. Add cream and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk sugar and eggs together in a bowl. Pour <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup hot <em>matcha</em> mixture into egg mixture, whisking quickly until thoroughly combined. Repeat with remaining <em>matcha</em> mixture. Pour mixture back into the pot.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir matcha mixture over medium-low heat until heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.</li>
